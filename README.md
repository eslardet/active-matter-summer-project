This repository contains a summary of my 10 week summer research project at Imperial College London.

## Overview
Active Brownian particles...

For a detailed overview of the project please read ... This explains all the equations and models behind the Python code, as well as discussion of relevant figures and analyses about phase separation and demixing. There is also an explanation of the efficient neighbour list used to speed up simulation times.


## Models
All the models have been updated to use an efficient combined neighbour list method, along with the Python package numba.

abp-one-pop.py: One population ABP model using Euler or SRK method.
abp-alpha-const.py: Two population ABP model with different (constant) persistences using Euler method.
abp-alpha-change.py
